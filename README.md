#Pipeline to predict conserved RNA structures in genomes or sequences of interest.

The pipeline is in 6-7 steps starting from input of sequences. This can either be entire genomes or sequences of choice (eg. UTR regions, RNAs from transcriptomes). Please make sure the sequences are in the DNA format (no 'U'), if starting from step 0. 

Figure 1: Overview of the pipeline. Each of the box are color-coded and marked to help identify the steps to be followed. Each of the steps are dispensable depending on which step user wishes to perform.
